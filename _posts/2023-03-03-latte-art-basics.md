# Latte Art Basics: Fundamental Pattern Tutorial

Latte art not only adds visual enjoyment to coffee but is also a way for baristas to showcase their skills. This article will introduce methods for creating several basic latte art patterns.

## Preparation

Before attempting latte art, you need to prepare:

1. **Quality Espresso**: Freshly extracted Espresso with rich coffee oils and crema
2. **Properly Textured Milk**: Temperature around 65°C, smooth like wet paint
3. **Suitable Coffee Cup**: Wide-mouthed cup with smooth inner walls
4. **Good Coffee Base**: Espresso should fill about 1/3 of the bottom of the cup

## Milk Frothing Techniques

The key to latte art is to prepare the perfect milk foam:

1. Use cold fresh milk (whole milk works best)
2. Place the steam wand at the edge of the milk pitcher, slightly below the surface
3. First introduce air to froth the milk (making a "tss-tss" sound)
4. Then submerge the steam wand deeper and continue to swirl and heat to 65°C
5. Tap the pitcher to remove large air bubbles, swirl to create a uniform texture

## Basic Pattern: Heart Shape

The heart is the most basic latte art pattern, with the following steps:

1. Slightly tilt the coffee cup
2. Start pouring milk from higher up, allowing the milk to sink to the bottom of the coffee
3. When the cup is about half full, lower the pouring height
4. Keep the pitcher centered over the coffee cup
5. When the pitcher is about to touch the coffee surface, begin to pour straight through the center
6. Finally lift the pitcher up to complete the top of the heart

## Advanced Pattern: Rosetta (or Fern)

The Rosetta is more variable than the heart, with the following steps:

1. Initial operation is the same as the heart
2. When starting the Rosetta pour, the pitcher needs to be gently rocked from side to side
3. This will create the serrated edges of the leaf
4. Finally, pour straight through the middle to complete the stem

## Dot Pattern (or Stacking)

The dot pattern is the foundation for creating more complex designs:

1. Keep the pouring height low, close to the coffee surface
2. Pour concentrically to form a white dot
3. Quickly raise the pitcher to allow the coffee color to cover the edges of the white dot
4. Repeating this process can create multiple rings

## Common Problems and Solutions

1. **Milk foam disappears too quickly**: Possibly insufficient foaming or temperature too high
2. **Pattern not clear**: Control pouring speed, or adjust milk and coffee contrast
3. **Unable to form a pattern**: Possibly the coffee lacks sufficient crema as a background

Latte art requires patience and lots of practice. Even the simplest heart pattern needs repeated practice to achieve satisfactory results. Enjoy your coffee art journey!
