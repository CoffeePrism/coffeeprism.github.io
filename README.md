## üì¶ GitHub Actions Guidelines

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy the website. Follow these guidelines to ensure successful publishing:

> **Important Rule**: Always check if the GitHub Actions build was successful after pushing code. If the build fails, check the error logs and fix the issues.

### Build Status Verification Process:

1. Push changes to GitHub repository
2. Go to the [Actions page](https://github.com/CoffeePrism/coffeeprism.github.io/actions) to check the build status
3. If the build fails:
   - Click on the failed workflow to view detailed logs
   - Identify the error cause (usually Liquid template errors, dependency issues, or YAML front matter formatting errors)
   - Fix the issues locally and push the changes
   - Repeat these steps until the build succeeds

For more detailed information, please see the GitHub Actions workflow section in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## üîß Cursor IDE Rules

This project includes custom rules for [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh/) to help developers avoid common errors and follow best practices:

- Reminders to check GitHub Actions build status after pushing code
- Checks for common Liquid template errors when saving files
- Prevention of using plugins not supported by GitHub Pages
- Reminders to test locally when modifying key files

These rules automatically take effect when editing this project with Cursor IDE. For detailed information, please see the [Cursor Rules Guide](docs/cursor-rules-guide.md).

## üöÄ How to Add New Content

### Adding Blog Posts

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `_posts` directory with the filename format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
2. Add YAML front matter at the beginning of the file, for example:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Article Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: Author Name
categories: [Category1, Category2]
tags: [Tag1, Tag2, Tag3]
featured: true/false
featured_image: /assets/images/image-name.jpg
excerpt: "Article summary"
---
```

3. Add the article content after the YAML front matter using Markdown format

### Adding Coffee Topics

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `collections/_coffee` directory
2. Add YAML front matter at the beginning of the file, for example:

```yaml
---
layout: coffee
title: "Coffee Name"
origin: "Origin"
roast_level: "Roast Level"
flavor_profile: ["Flavor1", "Flavor2", "Flavor3"]
tags: [Tag1, Tag2, Tag3]
featured_image: /assets/images/image-name.jpg
excerpt: "Brief description"
---
```

3. Add content after the YAML front matter using Markdown format

### Adding Coffee Equipment

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `collections/_equipment` directory
2. Add YAML front matter at the beginning of the file, for example:

```yaml
---
layout: equipment
title: "Equipment Name"
brand: "Brand"
type: "Equipment Type"
price_range: "Price Range"
tags: [Tag1, Tag2, Tag3]
featured_image: /assets/images/image-name.jpg
excerpt: "Brief description"
pros_cons:
  pros:
    - "Advantage 1"
    - "Advantage 2"
    - "Advantage 3"
  cons:
    - "Disadvantage 1"
    - "Disadvantage 2"
    - "Disadvantage 3"
---
```

3. Add content after the YAML front matter using Markdown format

### Adding Product Recommendations

1. Open the `_data/products.yml` file
2. Add a new product under the appropriate product category, for example:

```yaml
coffee_beans:
  - name: "Product Name"
    description: "Product Description"
    image: "/assets/images/products/image-name.jpg"
    price: "Price"
    amazon_id: "Amazon Product ID"
```

3. Ensure that the `amazon_id` is the correct Amazon product ID, which will be used to generate Amazon affiliate links

## üíª Local Development

To run the website locally for development and testing, follow these steps:

1. Make sure Ruby and Bundler are installed
2. Clone the repository locally
3. Run `bundle install` in the project root directory to install dependencies
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the local server
5. Visit `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to view the website

## üåê Deployment

After pushing changes to the main branch, the website will be automatically built and deployed.

## üñºÔ∏è Image Optimization

To improve website performance, ensure that uploaded images are optimized:
